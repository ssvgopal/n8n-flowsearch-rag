# 🚧 n8n RAG Workflows (Work in Progress) 🔧

> **Note:** This is an active work in progress! We're building a comprehensive collection of n8n workflows for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Your contributions and feedback are highly welcome as we shape this into a powerful toolkit for the community.

A growing collection of modular n8n workflows for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications, designed to be easily adaptable for various use cases. Whether you're building AI assistants, knowledge bases, or document processing pipelines, these workflows provide a solid foundation that you can customize for your needs.

## 🌟 Why Contribute?

- **Shape the Future**: Help define the direction of this toolkit
- **Learn & Grow**: Work with cutting-edge RAG technologies
- **Build Together**: Collaborate with a community of automation enthusiasts
- **Make an Impact**: Your contributions will help others in the n8n ecosystem

## 🚀 Current State & Goals

- **Growing Collection of Workflows**: We're continuously adding new RAG-related workflows
- **Multi-Platform Integration**: Connect with various data sources and AI models (OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, and more)
- **Highly Modular**: Mix and match components to build custom solutions
- **Community-Driven**: Built by and for the n8n community
- **Open Source**: MIT Licensed - use, modify, and distribute freely

## 🛠️ What We're Building

- [ ] Core RAG workflows for common use cases
- [ ] Integration with multiple LLM providers
- [ ] Support for various vector databases
- [ ] Pre-configured document processing pipelines
- [ ] Example implementations for different industries
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation and tutorials

- Access to AI models (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.)
- Required API keys for the services you plan to use

### Quick Start

1. **Fork** this repository to your GitHub account
2. **Clone** your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/n8n-rag-workflows.git
   cd n8n-rag-workflows
   ```
3. **Explore** the workflows in the `workflows/` directory
4. **Import** workflows into your n8n instance
5. **Customize** the configurations to match your needs
6. **Contribute back** your improvements!

## 🛠️ Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/n8n-rag-workflows.git
   cd n8n-rag-workflows
   ```

2. Set up your environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Update the values with your API keys and configuration

3. Import the workflows into your n8n instance

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:

```env
# OpenAI
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# Other API keys as needed
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_anthropic_api_key
# PINECONE_API_KEY=your_pinecone_api_key
```
